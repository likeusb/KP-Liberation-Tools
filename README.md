# KP-Liberation-Tools
I decided that spending 10 hours working on tools to make the presets for me was a better use of time than spending 10 minutes making the presets myself.

The project started out because of a really cool person on the KP Liberation discord server, TernaryOperator. He made a script for getting things like troop transports from a list of selected vehicles, perfect for quickly making OPFOR presets for KP Liberation. 
I then considered the idea of making a tool that gives you the OPFOR preset automatically through the use of markers and triggers and other fancy things. I mean, how hard could it be?
A few days, and many hours, later, I was done, and with quite a lot of motivation to continue, I then also made the guerilla and civilian preset tools on the side, because if I'm automating everything, I'm automating _**everything**_.
And that's the short summary of how this project started and why it's even a thing.

# Usage
The usage is pretty simple. I recommend downloading the All In One zip file from the releases page, following the instructions on that page, and simply using that one. It will be the most up to date and simplest to use, plus if you're making a KP lib run, you might as well just use all of them. It's not like skipping out on the rebel or civilian parts will harm the OPFOR creation (at least it shouldn't?), so you can feel free to pick which one to use.

# Missing features
It's unlikely that without more knowledge of SQF and Arma I will ever be able to add these parts, but for now, this is what is missing from the tool:
1. BLUFOR preset as a whole - Unfortunately, you'll have to do it yourself.
2. OPFOR preset flag classname - Arma is weird and for some reason does not let me select the flag using things like allObjects or a trigger's thisList, so for now, the flag classname has to be put in by hand, which is a little less than ideal.

# Want to contribute?
Feel free!
I'm always happy to share better, more efficient code, or have it do more things. If you can find a way to:
a) Make the code better (Less lines, more readable, faster, etc.)
b) Make the tool do more (BLUFOR preset or fixing some current missing elements)
Feel free to share it and I'll be more than happy to add the changes!
